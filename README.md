# Python Data Science Fundamentals

My hands-on learning path from Python basics to the data science stack. Everything here is something I wrote, practiced, and understood myself.

## What's Covered

### Python
Basics, data structures, control flow, functions, OOP, error handling, file handling, decorators, generators, and more. 42 files covering the language from scratch to advanced topics like `*args/**kwargs`, pattern matching, and custom packages.

### NumPy
Array operations, indexing, reshaping, and mathematical computations.

### Pandas
DataFrames, merging, joins, handling missing data, groupby, aggregation, and pivot tables. Practiced on real datasets including Olympics data and Global Superstore.

### Matplotlib
Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, subplots, and customization.

### Seaborn
Statistical visualizations — heatmaps, pair plots, box plots, violin plots, and distribution plots.

### SQLite3
Database operations with Python — creating tables, CRUD operations, joins, and aggregation queries.
