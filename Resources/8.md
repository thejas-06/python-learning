## **Conditional Statements in Python: `if`, `elif`, and `else`**

In programming, **conditional statements** are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to allow your program to make decisions.

### **1. The `if` Statement**

The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is **True**, the block of code under the `if` statement is executed.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
```

#### **Example**:
Let's say you want to check if it's time for dinner (assuming dinner time is 8 PM).

```python
time = 20  # 20 represents 8 PM in 24-hour format
if time == 20:
    print("It's time for dinner!")
```

Here, the program checks if the variable `time` is equal to 20 (8 PM). If it's 20, the message `"It's time for dinner!"` is printed.

### **2. The `else` Statement**

The `else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the `if` condition is **False**.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block if the condition is True
else:
    # Code block if the condition is False
```

#### **Example**:
Let's extend the dinner example by adding an alternative action if it's not 8 PM.

```python
time = 18  # 6 PM
if time == 20:
    print("It's time for dinner!")
else:
    print("It's not dinner time yet.")
```

If the condition (`time == 20`) is False (because the time is 6 PM), the program prints `"It's not dinner time yet."`

### **3. The `elif` Statement**

The `elif` (short for "else if") statement checks another condition if the previous `if` or `elif` condition was False. You can have multiple `elif` statements to test various conditions.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
if condition1:
    # Code block if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Code block if condition2 is True
else:
    # Code block if none of the above conditions are True
```

#### **Example**:
Let’s create a system to check meal times based on the time of the day:

```python
time = 15  # 3 PM

if time == 8:
    print("It's breakfast time!")
elif time == 13:
    print("It's lunch time!")
elif time == 20:
    print("It's dinner time!")
else:
    print("It's not a meal time.")
```

Here, the program checks multiple conditions:
- If the time is 8 AM, it prints `"It's breakfast time!"`.
- If the time is 1 PM, it prints `"It's lunch time!"`.
- If the time is 8 PM, it prints `"It's dinner time!"`.
- If none of these conditions are true, it prints `"It's not a meal time."`

### **4. Comparison Operators in `if` Statements**

You can use **comparison operators** to compare values in `if` statements:

- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `>`: Greater than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to

#### **Example**:
Let’s check if someone is eligible to vote in Karnataka (minimum age for voting is 18).

```python
age = 19

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

Here, the condition `age >= 18` checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If True, it prints that the person is eligible to vote. Otherwise, it prints that they are not eligible.

### **5. Logical Operators in `if` Statements**

You can also use **logical operators** to combine multiple conditions in `if` statements:

- `and`: Returns True if both conditions are True
- `or`: Returns True if at least one condition is True
- `not`: Reverses the result of a condition

#### **Example**:
Let’s say you want to check if someone is eligible for a student discount. The person must be both under 18 years of age and have a student ID.

```python
age = 16
has_student_id = True

if age < 18 and has_student_id:
    print("You are eligible for the student discount!")
else:
    print("You are not eligible for the student discount.")
```

Here, the condition `age < 18 and has_student_id` checks if both conditions are True. If so, the message `"You are eligible for the student discount!"` is printed.

### **6. Example: Checking Bus Ticket Prices**

Let’s create an example based on ticket prices for a Karnataka KSRTC bus. If the passenger is under 5 years old, the ticket is free. If the passenger is between 5 and 12 years old, they get a child discount. If the passenger is 60 years or older, they get a senior citizen discount. Otherwise, they pay the full fare.

```python
age = 65

if age < 5:
    print("Ticket is free.")
elif age <= 12:
    print("You get a child discount.")
elif age >= 60:
    print("You get a senior citizen discount.")
else:
    print("You pay the full fare.")
```

In this example:
- If the passenger is younger than 5 years, the output is `"Ticket is free."`
- If they are 5 to 12 years old, it prints `"You get a child discount."`
- If they are 60 or older, it prints `"You get a senior citizen discount."`
- For all other ages, it prints `"You pay the full fare."`

### **7. Nested `if` Statements**

You can also use `if` statements inside other `if` statements. This is called **nesting**.

#### **Example**:
Let’s say you’re planning to visit Mysuru. You want to decide whether to go based on the day of the week and the weather.

```python
day = "Saturday"
is_raining = False

if day == "Saturday" or day == "Sunday":
    if not is_raining:
        print("Let's visit Mysuru!")
    else:
        print("It's raining, let's stay home.")
else:
    print("It's a weekday, let's wait for the weekend.")
```

Here, the program first checks if it’s a weekend. If it is, it checks the weather. If it’s not raining, it prints `"Let's visit Mysuru!"`, otherwise, it prints `"It's raining, let's stay home."` On weekdays, it prints `"It's a weekday, let's wait for the weekend."`

### **8. Indentation in Python**

Python uses **indentation** (spaces at the beginning of a line) to define blocks of code. The indented code after an `if`, `elif`, or `else` statement belongs to that condition. Make sure to use consistent indentation to avoid errors.

#### **Example**:
```python
age = 19

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    print("Remember to bring your voter ID.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

In the example above, the two `print()` statements are part of the `if` block because they are indented. Be careful to maintain the correct indentation for your code to run correctly.

### **9. The `match-case` Statement (Python 3.10+)**

Starting from Python 3.10, you can use the match-case statement for pattern matching—similar to switch-case in other languages like C or JavaScript. It helps you write cleaner and more readable code when checking a variable against multiple constant values.

#### **Syntax**:

```python
match variable:
    case value1:
        # Code block for value1
    case value2:
        # Code block for value2
    case _:
        # Default case (like else)
```

#### **Example**:

Let’s check the type of day using match-case.

```python
day = "Sunday"

match day:
    case "Monday":
        print("Start of the work week.")
    case "Friday":
        print("Almost weekend!")
    case "Saturday" | "Sunday":
        print("It's the weekend!")
    case _:
        print("Just another weekday.")
```

* If `day` is `"Sunday"` or `"Saturday"`, it prints `"It's the weekend!"`
* The `_` is a wildcard that matches anything—like a default `else`.

This is functionally similar to the earlier `if-elif` example but can be more readable when checking one variable against many constant values.

> Note: Use match-case only if you're using Python 3.10 or newer. It’s not available in earlier versions.

### **practice questions**

1. **Basic Conditions**:
   - Write a program to check if someone is eligible for a bus pass. If they are below 5 years, the bus pass is free. If they are 60 years or older, they get a senior citizen discount. Otherwise, they pay the full price.
   
2. **Meal Time Checker**:
   - Create a program that checks the time of day (24-hour format) and prints whether it's time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
     - Breakfast: 8 AM
     - Lunch: 1 PM
     - Dinner: 8 PM
     - If none of these times, print "It's not meal time."

3. **Simple Eligibility Check**:
   - Write a program that checks whether a person is eligible for a library membership. If they are under 18, they get a student membership. If they are 60 or older, they get a senior citizen membership. Otherwise, they get a regular membership.
