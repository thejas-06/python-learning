## **Operators in Python**

### **1. Arithmetic Operators**
Python supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

#### **Common Operators:**
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `//` (Floor Division)
- `%` (Modulus)
- `**` (Exponentiation)

#### **Examples:**
```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a - b)  # Output: 7
print(a * b)  # Output: 30
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.3333...
print(a // b)  # Output: 3 (Floor Division)
print(a % b)  # Output: 1 (Modulus)
print(a ** b)  # Output: 1000 (Exponentiation)
```

### **2. Assignment Operators**

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The simplest one is `=` which assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. There are also compound assignment operators that combine arithmetic operations with assignment.

#### **Common Assignment Operators:**
- `=`: Assigns value on the right to the variable on the left.
- `+=`: Adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `-=`: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `*=`: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `/=`: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
- `%=`: Takes modulus of left operand by right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

#### **Examples**:
```python
x = 5  # Assigns 5 to x
x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3, now x is 8
x -= 2  # Equivalent to x = x - 2, now x is 6
x *= 4  # Equivalent to x = x * 4, now x is 24
x /= 6  # Equivalent to x = x / 6, now x is 4.0
```

### **3. Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return either `True` or `False` depending on the condition.

#### **Common Comparison Operators**:
- `==`: Checks if two values are equal.
- `!=`: Checks if two values are not equal.
- `>`: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- `<`: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- `>=`: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- `<=`: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

#### **Examples**:
```python
a = 10
b = 20

print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a > b)  # Output: False
print(a < b)  # Output: True
print(a >= 10)  # Output: True
print(b <= 25)  # Output: True
```

### **4. Logical Operators**

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They evaluate expressions and return either `True` or `False`.

#### **Common Logical Operators**:
- `and`: Returns `True` if both conditions are true.
- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
- `not`: Reverses the logical state of its operand (True becomes False, and vice versa).

#### **Examples**:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15

# and operator
print(x > 0 and y > 5)  # Output: True (both conditions are True)

# or operator
print(x > 10 or z > 10)  # Output: True (one of the conditions is True)

# not operator
print(not(x > 10))  # Output: True (reverses False to True)
```

### **5. Membership Operators**

Membership operators test for membership within a sequence, such as a list, string, or tuple. They return `True` or `False` based on whether the value is found in the sequence.

#### **Membership Operators**:
- `in`: Returns `True` if the specified value is found in the sequence.
- `not in`: Returns `True` if the specified value is not found in the sequence.

#### **Examples**:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_string = "Python"

print(3 in my_list)  # Output: True (3 is in the list)
print(6 not in my_list)  # Output: True (6 is not in the list)
print("P" in my_string)  # Output: True ("P" is in the string)
print("z" not in my_string)  # Output: True ("z" is not in the string)
```

### **6. Bitwise Operators**

Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers. These operators are useful for low-level programming tasks like working with bits and bytes.

#### **Common Bitwise Operators**:
- `&`: Bitwise AND (sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1).
- `|`: Bitwise OR (sets each bit to 1 if one of the bits is 1).
- `^`: Bitwise XOR (sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1).
- `~`: Bitwise NOT (inverts all the bits).
- `<<`: Left shift (shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions).
- `>>`: Right shift (shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions).

#### **Examples**:
```python
a = 5  # In binary: 101
b = 3  # In binary: 011

# Bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 1 (binary: 001)

# Bitwise OR
print(a | b)  # Output: 7 (binary: 111)

# Bitwise XOR
print(a ^ b)  # Output: 6 (binary: 110)

# Bitwise NOT
print(~a)  # Output: -6 (inverts all bits)

# Left shift
print(a << 1)  # Output: 10 (binary: 1010)

# Right shift
print(a >> 1)  # Output: 2 (binary: 010)
```
